    <p>sirenum scopuli is an experimental interactive video installation, made site specific for the ss keno and the yukon riverside arts festival 2023. it was created using the software touchdesigner and a webcam to trace the viewers movements and generate reactive audio and visuals. the background video was shot just outside, on the banks of the yukon river and overlaid with hand painted super8 film scans. </p>

    <p>according to virgil and ovid, the sirenum scopuli are the small islands on which the mythological sirens resided. this work is a meditation on the allure and precarity of the mighty yukon river, a mythical siren in its own right. you are invited to interact with the piece, whether by moving through the space and engaging the sirens, or by simply remaining still and observing.</p>
