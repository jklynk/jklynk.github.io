The start of the dailies on the new jklynk.com!

- Decided to rework my site (something I've been meaning to do) using small web principles after taking a workshop called "Introduction to making minimal websites and digital ephemera"

- I see this an artistic (is that redundant to state?) research-creation project. By working within small web principles I have very minute control over every aspect of design and can think much more critically about what I do, and how I do it. Moving away from simply aesthetic choices.

- Was challenge by my prof to structure my research question as a haiku. I quickly spit this out in class:

Deeper Digital
    
Making critical artwork
    
For a more just world

- Defintely touches on the broad picture I'm looking at, but I know it'll have to be narrowed down. Going to start thinking about specific mediums/techniques/theory I could hone in on.
