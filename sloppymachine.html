    <p>inspired by the early paik-abe video synthesizer, “sloppy machine” is an experimental audio/visual work comprising of randomly assorted ephemeral films and varying glitch effects, accompanied by a generative ambient soundtrack.</p>

    <p>the piece was commissioned for (s)hiver arts fest 2023 and was projected from the cfyt radio station onto the side of the dawson city general store:</p>

    <p>the ephemeral films used throughout were found on the open-source internet archive, and are cut randomly within touchdesigner using a technique developed by elekktronaut. these videos are then run through a series of various effects, with the wet/dry amount of each effect being determined by random noise. the same randomness which drives the effects is also fed into vcv rack to control the levels and parameters of various modular synth patches:</p>

    <p>the subtitles are generated by chatGPT based on the prompt: PLEASE WRITE ME 40 PROFOUND STATEMENTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SLOPPY MACHINE</p>
