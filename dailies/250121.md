The start of the dailies on the new jklynk.com!

\- Decided to rework my site (something I've been meaning to do) using small web principles after taking a workshop called "Introduction to making minimal websites and digital ephemera"

I see this an artistic (is that redundant to state?) research-creation project. By working within small web principles I have very minute control over every aspect of design and can think much more critically about what I do, and how I do it. Moving away from simply aesthetic choices.

It's also a decision to improve resiliency of my digital likeness. I am considering discontinuing my use of instagram and other major platforms in response to the shifting political landscape of social media. this site should encapsulate all that i want to present in the digital realm. by coding from scratch and keeping local repositories of all code, i can retain my work and move it to another host should github or whoever i host with decide to collapse.

\- Was challenge by my prof to structure my research question as a haiku. I quickly spit this out in class:

**Deeper Digital**

**Making critical artwork**Â 

**For a more just world**

this defintely touches on the broad picture I'm looking at, but I know it'll have to be narrowed down. Going to start thinking about specific mediums/techniques/theory I could hone in on.
