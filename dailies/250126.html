<p><strong>Thinking about my bike trailer projection unit idea:</strong></p>
<p>Back in my undergrad I had this idea for a bike trailer-based mobile projection unit. Not the most novel idea ever, but it’s always stuck with me. Now, as I try to dig deep in to my research focus, it arises again.</p>
<p>I’m trying to think of a way I can tie together the realms of Interactive/Immersive Digital Art and Critical Theory/Activism/Community Building/Direct Action (I’m still struggling to label it, but basically: un-fuck the world).</p>
<p>Lo and behold! What a brilliant bridge: the mobile projection unit. A towable bike trailer with a battery bank, computer, speakers and projector. Now that I think about it 10 years later, why not add some sorts of cameras, or sensors, or devices, or buttons, or levers to make it interactive?</p>
<p>Imagine the potential of this system! It could be deployed in pop-up fashion for free and open art exhibitions in the streets! It could be used for community building, or educating kids! It could be used for direction action against things like say… the removal of bikes lanes in the city of Toronto!!!</p>
<p>Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_By_Donkeys" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Led By Donkeys</a>, but powered by bike and interactive.</p>
<p>It’s also exciting because there are so many questions involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
How does one make powerful and engaging interactive art?
</li>
<li>
How does one make a positive difference in their community?
</li>
<li>
How should the project be deployed in public?
</li>
<li>
How do you build this?
</li>
<li>
How do you fund this?
</li>
<li>
What are the legal ramifications?
</li>
<li>
Is this entrepreneurship?
</li>
<li>
How can it be opened up to other creatives and activists beyond myself?
</li>
<li>
Does it even need to be projection based?
</li>
</ul>
