<p><strong>Thinking about the small web:</strong></p>
<p>I was born the same year as the internet. My dad was a software engineer for Westinghouse. I learned HTML and CSS and made small websites on Geocities. I had my own blog and was a part of a group blog run by some older kids I looked up to.</p>
<p>And then at some point, in high school, I joined Facebook. And ever since then I completely forgot about my autonomous ability to create and shape my own little slice of the world wide web. The freedom to properly shape my digital persona how I felt fit.</p>
<p>Rather than residing in the flourishing and vibrant neighborhoods of geociities, we are all now living in cookie cutter row houses of the Meta suburbs.</p>
<p>Inspired by a recent workshop on the “small web”, I’ve made the long overdue decision to overhaul my personal website.</p>
<p>The “small web” is equal parts political and aesthetic. It engages with questions, posed by the early web, about what it means to have a personal presence online but in the light of today’s ubiquitous social media and commercialization (<a href="https://endmatter.neocities.org/smallweb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://endmatter.neocities.org/smallweb</a>)</p>
<p>This is partly inspired by wanting to step away from the monolithic, commercialized, algorithmically-driven doom-pits of instagram and other “social” medias, but still retain a place of digital domain and a place to share my thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>I see this a research-creation project. By working within small web principles I have very minute control over every aspect of design and can think much more critically about what I do, and how I do it. It’s a conscious decision to move away from the simply aesthetic choices driven by a desire to fit in to what I thought an artist website should be.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking about my research question as a haiku:</strong></p>
<p>Was challenge by my prof to structure my research question as a haiku. I quickly spit this out in class:</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Digital</strong></p>
<p><strong>Making critical artwork&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For a more just world</strong></p>
<p>This touches on the broad picture I'm looking at, but I know it'll have to be narrowed down. Going to start thinking about specific mediums/techniques/theory I could hone in on.</p>
