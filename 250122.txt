Working on my new website and thinking though some design decisions:

- Inclusion of a "now" section in preperation for potentially ditching social media, inspired by https://nownownow.com/about

- What font-stack (https://modernfontstacks.com/) to use. Decided to switch from monospace to a sans-serif Neo-grotesque for improved accessibility

- What punctuation to use to format my title (j:klynk) and work titles (eg. dredge11[redux]). Considering how different punctuations are used in both written text and code, and what that entails is usage here.

- Layout: I like the one-pager with anchor links from a sticky menu. Allows user to scroll through everything, or power-users to jump around.

- What to label myself as, or whether to label myself at all. I’ve settled on experimental digital artist for now, but that is very much subject to change

- Inclusion of “dailies”: I want to start my own micro-blogging/journalling process to help me remember important thoughts and track what I’ve done over time. Might be helpful to others to see as well. I’ve been using the term dailies for the mini a/v things I’ve made, but I think it can encompass any work I do on a given day. I also like the reference to daily rushes in a filmmaking context. These dailies can (and maybe even should?) be rushed and unpolished/unedited.

- Handling dailies as .txt files for ease of upload and management

Thinking in response to the re-inauguration of the facists: our response should be to grow stronger, more resilient, both individually and collectively.
