    <h4><i>field test #1 findings (summarized by notebooklm):</i></h4>

   <p>

The field test of the Nomadic Open Display Engine one (NODE-1), the initial prototype for the Tactical Interaction Project (TIP), yielded several important findings regarding its functionality, mobility, and areas for future development.
<br><br>
<h4>Mobility and Durability Findings:</h4>
The system successfully withstood biking around in public, including going downhill, uphill, hitting bumps, and even some off-road excursions, without falling apart.... This was a crucial component of the test, as the project is designed to be mobile and bike-based.<br><br>
It was found to be pullable and doable despite being slow to accelerate due to its weight. The weight of the system (TV, steel, battery, inverter) is comparable to an earlier test where 80 lbs of cat litter was successfully biked uphill.<br><br>
A key observation was that the TV makes the system top-heavy, causing it to tip a little on speed bumps, indicating an area for caution or potential design modification.<br><br>
Weatherproofing was identified as something that will need to be considered in the future, as ideal conditions won't always be present.<br><br>
Navigating busy public areas like Woodbine Beach proved challenging, leading the operator to seek quieter spots to avoid potential collisions with pedestrians or children.
<br><br>
<h4>System Component and Setup Findings:</h4>
Upon inspection after riding, all components remained intact – the TV, mast, bags, projector, frame, and lights were still strongly attached and in one piece.<br><br>
The system successfully demonstrated its power system (battery bank, inverter) could run the TV and computers.<br><br>
An old sign repurposed as a protective cover for the TV fit perfectly and served its purpose well.<br><br>
A custom case and 3D-printed mount for the projector (Optima to Manfrotto) worked effectively for protection and quick attachment. The monopod attachment also successfully allowed the projector to be raised for better projection height.<br><br>
The ability to easily reposition the projection was demonstrated, though it necessitates careful keystone adjustment.<br><br>
The HDMI connection was found to be finicky and could lose connection if bumped, highlighting a need for a more robust connection.
<br><br>
<h4>Software and Connectivity Findings:</h4>
The initial plan to run the system off a Raspberry Pi Zero W was unsuccessful because it was underpowered and could not properly display a webpage, which was essential for the interactive message sign.<br><br>
When using an old Mac Mini as an alternative, a significant issue arose with automatic hotspot connection to a phone, making it difficult to control the system remotely via VNC or auto-load the webpage.<br><br>
While the Raspberry Pi eventually connected and displayed messages via a terminal-based Python program, this display was not aesthetically pleasing and messages were hard to see, underscoring the need for a better display method.<br><br>
The core functionality of the message wall – users scanning a QR code to enter a message (up to 25 characters) that instantly appears on the display – worked successfully when a more powerful computer (MacBook) was used for demonstration. This demonstrated the intended interactive experience, including the use of emojis.<br><br>
The QR code functionality also worked when projected onto a surface, although projecting onto uneven ground made the QR code harder to read, suggesting the need for focus adjustments and flatter projection surfaces.
<br><br>
<h4>Overall Conclusions and Future Work:</h4>
The project successfully demonstrated the core concept of an interactive digital tactical media display in an urban setting.
<br><br>
<h4>Key areas for future development include:</h4>
Improving the onboard computer system to eliminate the need for an external laptop, focusing on reliable hotspot connectivity and auto-loading the webpage.<br><br>
Refining projection mapping to be faster and more efficient.<br><br>
Considering a lighter and more slimmed-down system, potentially by deciding whether to include the TV or projector based on expected use (daytime vs. nighttime).<br><br>
Addressing the top-heavy nature of the TV for improved stability.<br><br>
Developing weatherproofing for the system.
<br><br>
Despite needing "some tuning up," the system was successfully "up, running, [and] out here in the world" as a tangible prototype. The field test also underscored the project's purpose of enabling artistic and activist interventions and serving as a means to share knowledge within an open-source community
