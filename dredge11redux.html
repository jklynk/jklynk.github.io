    <p>dredge11[redux] is a reactivation and reworking of dredge11[retrograde], now responding to the catastrophic leach pad failure at Eagle Gold Mine, which released millions of liters of cyanide solution, contaminating the Yukon environment. The two interactive video installations focus on Dredge #11 — a monumental gold-mining machine that once shaped the landscape, leaving behind vast tailings piles and altered terrain.</p>

<h4>DAY 1| October 30</h4>
<p>This piece is a continuously evolving collage that combines aerial footage of the dredge and
surrounding tailings piles with 16mm celluloid film scans. These scans are phytogrammed and
developed using plant matter gathered from the area around the dredge site. Viewers disrupt
the piece through digital interaction, inspired by the photographic process of Mordançage,
where acidic solutions lift emulsion from film, revealing both fragility and resilience.</p>

<h4>DAY 2 | October 31</h4>
<p>This piece invites viewers into a navigable, interactive particle system derived from a 3D scan
ofthe dredge’s interior and exterior.As viewers engage,the dredge becomes a dynamic entity
—its structure fragmenting and reconfiguring with each interaction. Accompanied by a
soundtrack of generative modular synths and field recordings from within the dredge,the
piece immerses viewers in a space of both decay and creation.</p>

<p>Together,these works explore the destructive impact of mineral extraction on the Yukon
landscape while presenting the potentialforreclamation. Yet, this reclamation remains
uncertain—fragile, even—as the future unfolds ambiguously.</p>
